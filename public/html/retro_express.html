    <h2>3D Flying Game built with Three.js</h2>
    <p>This was my final project for General Assembly.  Along with my partner, Spencer Denauski, we designed the game logic, 3 dimensional design, enemy generation, flight simulation, and all the other fun 3D stuff. This was my first try at developing in 3D, and I absolutely loved it!</p>
